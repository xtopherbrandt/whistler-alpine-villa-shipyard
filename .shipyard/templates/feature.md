# REQUIRED at /ship-review approval-time:
# demo_probe: |
#   <single shell command, exit 0 == feature works end-to-end, observable
#    output, deterministic, bounded ≤120s. Distinct from per-task acceptance
#    probes — this exercises the cross-task user-facing flow. Authored by
#    /ship-discuss alongside acceptance criteria; consumed by /ship-review's
#    Stage 4.8 demo verification before user approval is offered.>
# Example:
#   demo_probe: |
#     curl -fsS -X POST localhost:3000/auth/signup -d '{"email":"d@d.io","password":"x"}' \
#       | jq -e .id
# Without one, /ship-review refuses to advance to user approval. If the
# feature is genuinely too cross-cutting to demo (rare), explicitly mark:
#   demo_probe: skip-with-reason
#   demo_probe_skip_reason: "<why the cross-task flow can't be one shell command>"
# and reviewer surfaces it to user as a known limitation.
